A change-control system for governed AI-assisted development.

The factory enforces that all work is scoped, intentional, and accepted
through a risk-proportional process before it is considered done.

It is not a project management tool. It is a **governance artifact store**
with deterministic derivation rules.

---

## Why

AI agents can implement code. They cannot judge whether a change is safe
to ship. The factory separates implementation (which agents can do) from
acceptance (which requires human authority for high-risk changes).

Every change must declare its intent and scope before implementation
begins. Acceptance criteria are determined by change class, not by
the implementer.

The native factory flow is:

`intent/spec -> planner -> feature + dev/qa packets -> human approval -> supervisor -> developer/reviewer agents -> acceptance -> delivery`

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm (or npm/yarn — adjust `factory.config.json` accordingly)

### Add to an Existing Project

```sh
# Add factory as a git submodule (hidden — tooling only)
git submodule add https://github.com/custodyzero/factory.git .factory

# Run setup (installs deps, copies templates, creates artifact dirs, configures hooks)
./.factory/setup.sh

# Configure for your project
# Edit factory.config.json — set project_name and verification commands
```

### Configure for Your Project

Edit `factory.config.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "project_name": "my-project",
  "factory_dir": ".factory",
  "artifact_dir": "factory",
  "verification": {
    "build": "dotnet build",
    "lint": "true",
    "test": "dotnet test"
  },
  "validation": {
    "command": "npx tsx .factory/tools/validate.ts"
  },
  "infrastructure_patterns": [
    ".factory/",
    "factory/",
    ".github/",
    "package.json",
    ".gitignore",
    "CLAUDE.md",
    "AGENTS.md",
    "README.md",
    "LICENSE"
  ],
  "completed_by_default": {
    "kind": "agent",
    "id": "claude"
  },
  "personas": {
    "planner": {
      "description": "Decomposes intent into feature and packet artifacts",
      "instructions": [],

    }
  }
}
```

## Planner-Native Flow

Factory now has a first-class planning layer. The preferred flow is:

1. Human creates an intent/spec artifact in `intents/`
2. Planner agent runs `tools/plan.ts <intent-id>`
3. Planner writes one planned feature plus dev/qa packet pairs
4. Human reviews and approves the feature
5. Supervisor executes only approved packet work

The planner and supervisor are intentionally separate:
- planner decomposes work into artifacts
- supervisor executes approved artifacts deterministically

## Your First Change

Factory has no `create` command — intent, feature, and packet artifacts are JSON
files you write by hand (or have an AI agent write). The planner-native flow above
is the preferred path. The walkthrough below shows the lower-level direct packet flow.

### 1. Create a dev packet

```json
// factory/packets/add-health-endpoint-dev.json
{
  "id": "add-health-endpoint-dev",
  "kind": "dev",
  "title": "Add /health endpoint",
  "intent": "Expose a health check endpoint so load balancers can verify the service is running.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "GET /health returns 200 with { \"status\": \"ok\" }",
    "Response time is under 50ms",
    "Endpoint is included in API tests"
  ],
  "change_class": "local",
  "scope": { "packages": ["api"] },
  "owner": "alice",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "started_at": null,
  "dependencies": [],
  "feature_id": null
}
```

### 2. Create its QA counterpart

```json
// factory/packets/add-health-endpoint-qa.json
{
  "id": "add-health-endpoint-qa",
  "kind": "qa",
  "verifies": "add-health-endpoint-dev",
  "title": "Verify /health endpoint",
  "intent": "Confirm the health endpoint meets all acceptance criteria from the dev packet.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "All dev packet acceptance criteria verified",
    "No regressions in existing API tests"
  ],
  "change_class": "local",
  "scope": { "packages": ["api"] },
  "owner": "alice",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "started_at": null,
  "dependencies": ["add-health-endpoint-dev"]
}
```

### 3. Check factory status

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts
```

You'll see both packets listed as `not_started`.

### 4. Implement the dev packet

Claim the packet to mark work as in progress. Write the
code, then run completion:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/start.ts add-health-endpoint-dev
npx tsx .factory/tools/complete.ts add-health-endpoint-dev
```

This runs build + lint + tests and writes `factory/completions/add-health-endpoint-dev.json`.
Since the change class is `local`, it auto-accepts.

### 5. Review the QA packet

The QA packet is now unblocked (its dependency is complete). A different
agent or human reviews the dev work against the acceptance criteria, then:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/start.ts add-health-endpoint-qa
npx tsx .factory/tools/complete.ts add-health-endpoint-qa --identity claude-qa
```

The `--identity` flag ensures the QA completion is attributed to a different
identity than the dev completion (FI-7).
If the QA packet declares `environment_dependencies`, matching evidence records
must exist before completion.

### 6. Commit

The pre-commit hook verifies that all started packets have completions.
Your commit includes the implementation files alongside the factory
artifacts — the governance trail is part of the repo history.

### Using features for larger work

For multi-packet work, wrap packets in a feature:

```json
// factory/features/health-monitoring.json
{
  "id": "health-monitoring",
  "intent": "Add health monitoring so ops can verify service availability.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Health endpoint exists and is tested",
    "Monitoring dashboard updated"
  ],
  "status": "approved",
  "packets": [
    "add-health-endpoint-dev",
    "add-health-endpoint-qa"
  ],
  "created_by": { "kind": "human", "id": "alice" },
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Then use `execute.ts` to drive the execution loop — it tells you which
packets are ready, which persona to use, and what to do next:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts health-monitoring
```

### Using intents for planner-native work

For planner-driven work, start with an intent artifact:

```json
// factory/intents/customer-dashboard.json
{
  "id": "customer-dashboard",
  "title": "Customer dashboard",
  "spec": "Provide a dashboard where users can view account activity and billing status.",
  "constraints": [
    "Preserve the existing public API",
    "Split work into auditable dev/qa packet pairs"
  ],
  "status": "proposed",
  "feature_id": null,
  "created_by": { "kind": "human", "id": "alice" },
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Then run the planner handoff resolver:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/plan.ts customer-dashboard
```

`plan.ts` returns the planner persona, model, and instructions for generating:
- one planned feature artifact
- dev/qa packet pairs
- dependencies and change classes
- explicit acceptance criteria

---

## Artifact Types

The factory has seven artifact types. Each is a JSON file validated against
a schema in `.factory/schemas/` (or `schemas/` when working in the factory
repo itself).

All artifact paths below are relative to the artifact root. In submodule
installs this is `factory/` (e.g., `factory/packets/my-packet.json`). When
factory is the project, this is the repo root.

### Intent

A high-level spec or problem statement that the planner decomposes into a feature
and dev/qa packet pairs.

```
intents/<intent-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `id` — kebab-case identifier (must match filename)
- `title` — one-line summary of the requested outcome
- `spec` — planner input describing the desired system behavior or change
- `status` — `proposed`, `planned`, `superseded`, or `delivered`
- `created_by` — who created the intent
- `created_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp

Optional fields:
- `constraints` — planner constraints or non-goals
- `feature_id` — generated feature linked to this intent
- `planned_at` — when planning completed

### Packet

A scoped unit of work. Declares **what** is changing, **why**, and
**which packages** are affected.

```
packets/<packet-id>.json
```

Every packet has a **kind**: `dev` (implements a change) or `qa` (verifies
a dev packet's acceptance criteria were met). Each dev packet in a feature
must have a corresponding QA packet (FI-8).

A QA packet sets `verifies` to the ID of the dev packet it reviews, and
lists that dev packet in `dependencies` so the factory sequences them
automatically — QA only becomes ready after dev completes.

Required fields:
- `id` — kebab-case identifier (must match filename)
- `kind` — `dev` or `qa`
- `title` — one-line summary
- `intent` — what is changing and why
- `acceptance_criteria` — testable conditions for completeness
- `change_class` — `trivial`, `local`, `cross_cutting`, or `architectural`
- `scope.packages` — which packages are affected
- `owner` — who is responsible
- `created_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp

QA-specific fields:
- `verifies` — ID of the dev packet this QA packet reviews (required for `qa`, forbidden for `dev`)

Optional fields:
- `started_at` — when work began (normally set by `tools/start.ts`)
- `dependencies` — packet IDs that must be completed first
- `environment_dependencies` — external dependencies requiring evidence
- `model` — model tier override (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`)
- `instructions` — additional agent instructions (merged with persona instructions)
- `status` — `abandoned` or `deferred` (exempt from FI-6/FI-7)
- `feature_id` — parent feature ID
- `tags` — freeform labels

### Completion

Evidence that a packet's implementation is done. Created by `complete.ts`,
not by hand.

```
completions/<packet-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `packet_id` — must reference an existing packet
- `completed_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `completed_by` — identity (`{ kind, id }`)
- `summary` — what was done
- `verification` — `{ tests_pass, build_pass, lint_pass, ci_pass }` (all booleans)

### Acceptance

Human approval that a completed packet is accepted. Created by `accept.ts`.

```
acceptances/<packet-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `packet_id` — must reference a packet with a valid completion
- `accepted_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `accepted_by` — identity (must be `human`, `cli`, or `ui` — **never `agent`**)

### Rejection

Reverts an auto-accepted cross-cutting packet back to completed status.

```
rejections/<packet-id>.json
```

### Evidence

Proof that an environment dependency has been satisfied.

```
evidence/<dependency-key>.json
```

### Feature

A high-level intent that decomposes into dev/qa packet pairs.

```
features/<feature-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `id` — kebab-case identifier (must match filename)
- `intent` — what the project should do when this feature is complete
- `acceptance_criteria` — feature-level success conditions
- `status` — `draft`, `planned`, `approved`, `executing`, `completed`, `delivered`
- `packets` — ordered list of packet IDs (dev and qa)
- `created_by` — identity

---

## Lifecycle

```
not_started → in_progress → completed → accepted
                                ↑            |
                                |  (rejection)|
                                +-------------+
```

A packet moves through states based on which artifacts exist:

| State                | Condition                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `not_started`        | No completion, `started_at` is null               |
| `in_progress`        | No completion, `started_at` is set                |
| `environment_pending`| Completion exists, but environment deps are unmet |
| `completed`          | Completion exists, not yet accepted                |
| `accepted`           | Acceptance criteria satisfied (see below)          |

---

## Acceptance Rules

Acceptance is **proportional to risk**.

| Change Class    | Acceptance Path                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `trivial`       | Auto-accepted when verification passes                       |
| `local`         | Auto-accepted when verification passes                       |
| `cross_cutting` | Auto-accepted with audit flag (human can reject)             |
| `architectural` | Requires explicit human acceptance record                    |

---

## Factory Invariants

### Artifact Integrity

**FI-1 — One completion per packet.**

**FI-2 — One acceptance per packet.**

**FI-3 — No agent acceptance or rejection.**
Only `human`, `cli`, or `ui` identities may author acceptance or rejection records.

**FI-4 — No acceptance without completion.**

### Acceptance Rules

**FI-5 — Architectural packets cannot auto-accept.**
Architectural dev packets require explicit human acceptance after their QA counterpart completes.

### Execution Governance

**FI-6 — No progression without completion.**
If a started packet lacks a completion record, no newer packet may have a completion.
Packets marked `abandoned` or `deferred` are exempt.

**FI-7 — Commit-time completion enforcement and reviewer separation.**
A commit must not include implementation files while any started packet lacks
a completion. Enforced by the pre-commit hook.
A QA packet must not be completed by the same identity that completed its dev counterpart.

### Structural Integrity

**FI-8 — Every dev packet in a feature must have a QA counterpart.**
For each dev packet in a feature, a QA packet with `verifies` pointing to that dev packet
must exist in the same feature. Abandoned/deferred packets are exempt.

**FI-9 — No cyclic packet dependencies.**
The dependency graph across all packets must be a DAG. Cycles cause permanent blocked state.

**FI-10 — Feature status must reflect reality.**
Features marked `completed` or `delivered` must have completion records for all
active (non-abandoned, non-deferred) packets.

### Schema Invariants (enforced at schema and validation levels)

- Packet `kind` must be `dev` or `qa`
- QA packets must set `verifies` to a valid dev packet ID
- Dev packets must not set `verifies`
- Packet and feature `acceptance_criteria` must be non-empty
- Packet IDs must match filenames (kebab-case)
- Feature `packets` must reference existing packet IDs
- Identity objects must have `kind` and `id` fields
- Orphaned completions, acceptances, and rejections are errors

---

## Tooling

When installed as a submodule at `.factory/`, tool paths use `.factory/tools/...`.
When working in the factory repo itself, use `tools/...` directly.

### Status

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts              # human-readable report
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts --json       # machine-readable JSON
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts --feature <id>  # scoped to a feature
```

### Start

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/start.ts <packet-id>
```

Claims a packet and marks it started before implementation begins.

### Complete

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/complete.ts <packet-id> [--summary "..."]
```

Runs verification (build, lint, test), then creates a completion record.

### Execute

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts <feature-id>
npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts <feature-id> --json
```

Stateless action resolver for feature-level execution.

### Plan

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/plan.ts <intent-id>
npx tsx .factory/tools/plan.ts <intent-id> --json
```

Planner handoff resolver. Reads an intent/spec artifact and tells the planner
whether it needs to decompose work, wait for approval, or hand off to the supervisor.

### Supervise

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/supervise.ts --init
npx tsx .factory/tools/supervise.ts --json
```

Supervisor tick loop for automated orchestration. In supervisor mode,
`execute_feature` returns stable dispatch records that act as the only legal
authorization for packet start/agent spawn.

### Validate

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/validate.ts
```

Schema validation + referential integrity + invariant enforcement.

### Derive

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/derive.ts              # print to stdout
npx tsx .factory/tools/derive.ts --write      # write to derived-state.json
```

---

## Features

Feature lifecycle:
```
draft → planned → approved → executing → completed → delivered
```

Execution protocol:
1. Run `npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts <feature-id>`
2. Spawn agents for ready packets using the assigned persona (developer/reviewer)
3. Each agent: run `start.ts` for its assigned packet → implement → complete → commit
4. Re-run execute
5. Repeat until all_complete
6. Natural flow per story: dev packet (developer) → QA packet (reviewer) → acceptance (human, if architectural)

If supervisor mode is enabled, packets must be returned by `supervise.ts` before they can be started.
Supervisor `execute_feature` actions now include stable dispatch records so an outer orchestrator
can treat them as the only legal packet authorizations for that tick.

### End-to-End Supervisor Flow

This is the intended automated flow when a human wants the factory to drive a feature
through developer and QA agents:

1. Human creates the feature JSON and dev/QA packet JSON files.
2. Human approves the feature (`status: "approved"`).
3. Initialize supervisor state once: `npx tsx .factory/tools/supervise.ts --init`
4. Supervisor agent runs `npx tsx .factory/tools/supervise.ts --json`
5. If the result is `execute_feature`, the supervisor spawns one agent per dispatch in `dispatches`
6. Each spawned agent runs the returned `start_command`, performs only that packet’s work, then runs `complete.ts`
7. QA agents use `--identity <qa-id>` and must satisfy any `environment_dependencies` evidence requirement
8. Supervisor re-runs `supervise.ts --json` after each state change
9. If the result is `escalate_acceptance`, the human runs `accept.ts` for the listed architectural packet(s)
10. Repeat until the supervisor returns `idle`

The key rule is that the outer orchestrator must never invent its own packet assignments.
It should only spawn agents from the current tick’s `dispatches`.

### End-to-End Planner + Supervisor Flow

This is the full factory-native flow with planning and execution separated:

1. Human writes `intents/<intent-id>.json`
2. Planner agent runs `npx tsx .factory/tools/plan.ts <intent-id> --json`
3. If the action is `plan_feature`, the planner writes:
   - one `features/<feature-id>.json` artifact with `status: "planned"`
   - dev/qa packet pairs in `packets/`
   - packet dependencies, change classes, and acceptance criteria
   - `feature.intent_id` and `intent.feature_id` linkage
4. Human reviews the planned feature and packet set
5. Human sets the feature status to `approved`
6. Supervisor runs `npx tsx .factory/tools/supervise.ts --json`
7. Supervisor dispatches only approved packet work
8. Developer and reviewer agents execute packets exactly as assigned
9. Human handles architectural acceptance when escalated
10. Delivery occurs when the approved feature completes and the intent can be considered delivered

```

**Key separation:** Tooling lives in `.factory/` (hidden submodule).
Artifacts live in `factory/` (visible, single directory). The `factory_dir`
config field points to the tooling submodule, `artifact_dir` points to
the artifact directory. Tools resolve paths via `resolveArtifactRoot()`
and `resolveFactoryRoot()`.
