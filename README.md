A change-control system for governed AI-assisted development.

The factory enforces that all work is scoped, intentional, and accepted
through a risk-proportional process before it is considered done.

It is not a project management tool. It is a **governance artifact store**
with deterministic derivation rules.

---

## Why

AI agents can implement code. They cannot judge whether a change is safe
to ship. The factory separates implementation (which agents can do) from
acceptance (which requires human authority for high-risk changes).

Every change must declare its intent and scope before implementation
begins. Acceptance criteria are determined by change class, not by
the implementer.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm (or npm/yarn — adjust `factory.config.json` accordingly)

### Add to an Existing Project

```sh
# Add factory as a git submodule (hidden — tooling only)
git submodule add https://github.com/custodyzero/factory.git .factory

# Run setup (installs deps, copies templates, creates artifact dirs, configures hooks)
./.factory/setup.sh

# Configure for your project
# Edit factory.config.json — set project_name and verification commands
```

### Configure for Your Project

Edit `factory.config.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "project_name": "my-project",
  "factory_dir": ".factory",
  "artifact_dir": "factory",
  "verification": {
    "build": "dotnet build",
    "lint": "true",
    "test": "dotnet test"
  },
  "validation": {
    "command": "npx tsx .factory/tools/validate.ts"
  },
  "infrastructure_patterns": [
    ".factory/",
    "factory/",
    ".github/",
    "package.json",
    ".gitignore",
    "CLAUDE.md",
    "AGENTS.md",
    "README.md",
    "LICENSE"
  ],
  "completed_by_default": {
    "kind": "agent",
    "id": "claude"
  }
}
```

---

## Your First Change

Factory has no `create` command — features and packets are JSON files you
write by hand (or have an AI agent write). This walkthrough shows the full
cycle for a single change using a standalone packet.

### 1. Create a dev packet

```json
// factory/packets/add-health-endpoint-dev.json
{
  "id": "add-health-endpoint-dev",
  "kind": "dev",
  "title": "Add /health endpoint",
  "intent": "Expose a health check endpoint so load balancers can verify the service is running.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "GET /health returns 200 with { \"status\": \"ok\" }",
    "Response time is under 50ms",
    "Endpoint is included in API tests"
  ],
  "change_class": "local",
  "scope": { "packages": ["api"] },
  "owner": "alice",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "started_at": null,
  "dependencies": [],
  "feature_id": null
}
```

### 2. Create its QA counterpart

```json
// factory/packets/add-health-endpoint-qa.json
{
  "id": "add-health-endpoint-qa",
  "kind": "qa",
  "verifies": "add-health-endpoint-dev",
  "title": "Verify /health endpoint",
  "intent": "Confirm the health endpoint meets all acceptance criteria from the dev packet.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "All dev packet acceptance criteria verified",
    "No regressions in existing API tests"
  ],
  "change_class": "local",
  "scope": { "packages": ["api"] },
  "owner": "alice",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "started_at": null,
  "dependencies": ["add-health-endpoint-dev"]
}
```

### 3. Check factory status

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts
```

You'll see both packets listed as `not_started`.

### 4. Implement the dev packet

Set `started_at` in the dev packet to mark work as in progress. Write the
code, then run completion:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/complete.ts add-health-endpoint-dev
```

This runs build + lint + tests and writes `factory/completions/add-health-endpoint-dev.json`.
Since the change class is `local`, it auto-accepts.

### 5. Review the QA packet

The QA packet is now unblocked (its dependency is complete). A different
agent or human reviews the dev work against the acceptance criteria, then:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/complete.ts add-health-endpoint-qa --identity claude-qa
```

The `--identity` flag ensures the QA completion is attributed to a different
identity than the dev completion (FI-7).

### 6. Commit

The pre-commit hook verifies that all started packets have completions.
Your commit includes the implementation files alongside the factory
artifacts — the governance trail is part of the repo history.

### Using features for larger work

For multi-packet work, wrap packets in a feature:

```json
// factory/features/health-monitoring.json
{
  "id": "health-monitoring",
  "intent": "Add health monitoring so ops can verify service availability.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Health endpoint exists and is tested",
    "Monitoring dashboard updated"
  ],
  "status": "approved",
  "packets": [
    "add-health-endpoint-dev",
    "add-health-endpoint-qa"
  ],
  "created_by": { "kind": "human", "id": "alice" },
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Then use `execute.ts` to drive the execution loop — it tells you which
packets are ready, which persona to use, and what to do next:

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts health-monitoring
```

---

## Artifact Types

The factory has six artifact types. Each is a JSON file validated against
a schema in `.factory/schemas/` (or `schemas/` when working in the factory
repo itself).

All artifact paths below are relative to the artifact root. In submodule
installs this is `factory/` (e.g., `factory/packets/my-packet.json`). When
factory is the project, this is the repo root.

### Packet

A scoped unit of work. Declares **what** is changing, **why**, and
**which packages** are affected.

```
packets/<packet-id>.json
```

Every packet has a **kind**: `dev` (implements a change) or `qa` (verifies
a dev packet's acceptance criteria were met). Each dev packet in a feature
must have a corresponding QA packet (FI-8).

A QA packet sets `verifies` to the ID of the dev packet it reviews, and
lists that dev packet in `dependencies` so the factory sequences them
automatically — QA only becomes ready after dev completes.

Required fields:
- `id` — kebab-case identifier (must match filename)
- `kind` — `dev` or `qa`
- `title` — one-line summary
- `intent` — what is changing and why
- `acceptance_criteria` — testable conditions for completeness
- `change_class` — `trivial`, `local`, `cross_cutting`, or `architectural`
- `scope.packages` — which packages are affected
- `owner` — who is responsible
- `created_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp

QA-specific fields:
- `verifies` — ID of the dev packet this QA packet reviews (required for `qa`, forbidden for `dev`)

Optional fields:
- `started_at` — when work began
- `dependencies` — packet IDs that must be completed first
- `environment_dependencies` — external dependencies requiring evidence
- `model` — model tier override (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`)
- `instructions` — additional agent instructions (merged with persona instructions)
- `status` — `abandoned` or `deferred` (exempt from FI-6/FI-7)
- `feature_id` — parent feature ID
- `tags` — freeform labels

### Completion

Evidence that a packet's implementation is done. Created by `complete.ts`,
not by hand.

```
completions/<packet-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `packet_id` — must reference an existing packet
- `completed_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `completed_by` — identity (`{ kind, id }`)
- `summary` — what was done
- `verification` — `{ tests_pass, build_pass, lint_pass, ci_pass }` (all booleans)

### Acceptance

Human approval that a completed packet is accepted. Created by `accept.ts`.

```
acceptances/<packet-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `packet_id` — must reference a packet with a valid completion
- `accepted_at` — ISO 8601 timestamp
- `accepted_by` — identity (must be `human`, `cli`, or `ui` — **never `agent`**)

### Rejection

Reverts an auto-accepted cross-cutting packet back to completed status.

```
rejections/<packet-id>.json
```

### Evidence

Proof that an environment dependency has been satisfied.

```
evidence/<dependency-key>.json
```

### Feature

A high-level intent that decomposes into dev/qa packet pairs.

```
features/<feature-id>.json
```

Required fields:
- `id` — kebab-case identifier (must match filename)
- `intent` — what the project should do when this feature is complete
- `acceptance_criteria` — feature-level success conditions
- `status` — `draft`, `planned`, `approved`, `executing`, `completed`, `delivered`
- `packets` — ordered list of packet IDs (dev and qa)
- `created_by` — identity

---

## Lifecycle

```
not_started → in_progress → completed → accepted
                                ↑            |
                                |  (rejection)|
                                +-------------+
```

A packet moves through states based on which artifacts exist:

| State                | Condition                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `not_started`        | No completion, `started_at` is null               |
| `in_progress`        | No completion, `started_at` is set                |
| `environment_pending`| Completion exists, but environment deps are unmet |
| `completed`          | Completion exists, not yet accepted                |
| `accepted`           | Acceptance criteria satisfied (see below)          |

---

## Acceptance Rules

Acceptance is **proportional to risk**.

| Change Class    | Acceptance Path                                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `trivial`       | Auto-accepted when verification passes                       |
| `local`         | Auto-accepted when verification passes                       |
| `cross_cutting` | Auto-accepted with audit flag (human can reject)             |
| `architectural` | Requires explicit human acceptance record                    |

---

## Factory Invariants

### Artifact Integrity

**FI-1 — One completion per packet.**

**FI-2 — One acceptance per packet.**

**FI-3 — No agent acceptance or rejection.**
Only `human`, `cli`, or `ui` identities may author acceptance or rejection records.

**FI-4 — No acceptance without completion.**

### Acceptance Rules

**FI-5 — Architectural packets cannot auto-accept.**
Architectural dev packets require explicit human acceptance after their QA counterpart completes.

### Execution Governance

**FI-6 — No progression without completion.**
If a started packet lacks a completion record, no newer packet may have a completion.
Packets marked `abandoned` or `deferred` are exempt.

**FI-7 — Commit-time completion enforcement and reviewer separation.**
A commit must not include implementation files while any started packet lacks
a completion. Enforced by the pre-commit hook.
A QA packet must not be completed by the same identity that completed its dev counterpart.

### Structural Integrity

**FI-8 — Every dev packet in a feature must have a QA counterpart.**
For each dev packet in a feature, a QA packet with `verifies` pointing to that dev packet
must exist in the same feature. Abandoned/deferred packets are exempt.

**FI-9 — No cyclic packet dependencies.**
The dependency graph across all packets must be a DAG. Cycles cause permanent blocked state.

**FI-10 — Feature status must reflect reality.**
Features marked `completed` or `delivered` must have completion records for all
active (non-abandoned, non-deferred) packets.

### Schema Invariants (enforced at schema and validation levels)

- Packet `kind` must be `dev` or `qa`
- QA packets must set `verifies` to a valid dev packet ID
- Dev packets must not set `verifies`
- Packet and feature `acceptance_criteria` must be non-empty
- Packet IDs must match filenames (kebab-case)
- Feature `packets` must reference existing packet IDs
- Identity objects must have `kind` and `id` fields
- Orphaned completions, acceptances, and rejections are errors

---

## Tooling

When installed as a submodule at `.factory/`, tool paths use `.factory/tools/...`.
When working in the factory repo itself, use `tools/...` directly.

### Status

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts              # human-readable report
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts --json       # machine-readable JSON
npx tsx .factory/tools/status.ts --feature <id>  # scoped to a feature
```

### Complete

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/complete.ts <packet-id> [--summary "..."]
```

Runs verification (build, lint, test), then creates a completion record.

### Execute

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts <feature-id>
npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts <feature-id> --json
```

Stateless action resolver for feature-level execution.

### Validate

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/validate.ts
```

Schema validation + referential integrity + invariant enforcement.

### Derive

```sh
npx tsx .factory/tools/derive.ts              # print to stdout
npx tsx .factory/tools/derive.ts --write      # write to derived-state.json
```

---

## Features

Feature lifecycle:
```
draft → planned → approved → executing → completed → delivered
```

Execution protocol:
1. Run `npx tsx .factory/tools/execute.ts <feature-id>`
2. Spawn agents for ready packets using the assigned persona (developer/reviewer)
3. Each agent: implement → complete → commit
4. Re-run execute
5. Repeat until all_complete
6. Natural flow per story: dev packet (developer) → QA packet (reviewer) → acceptance (human, if architectural)

```

**Key separation:** Tooling lives in `.factory/` (hidden submodule).
Artifacts live in `factory/` (visible, single directory). The `factory_dir`
config field points to the tooling submodule, `artifact_dir` points to
the artifact directory. Tools resolve paths via `resolveArtifactRoot()`
and `resolveFactoryRoot()`.

---

## Installation

```sh
# From your project root
git submodule add https://github.com/custodyzero/factory.git .factory
./.factory/setup.sh
```

The setup script:
1. Installs factory dependencies (isolated in `.factory/node_modules/`)
2. Copies template `factory.config.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to your project root (no-clobber)
3. Creates `factory/` directory with artifact subdirectories and supervisor files
4. Configures `git config core.hooksPath .factory/hooks`

See [`docs/integration.md`](docs/integration.md) for detailed integration guide.
